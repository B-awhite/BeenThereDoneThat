## Been There Done That 

Been There Done That is an easy to use JavaScript app that allows users to create a grocery like list of all the places they want to travel to. All the user has to do is type in the country/state and the city of the destination they want to travel to and hit the create button. Once the location is created the user then has the option to delete it if they've crossed it off of the list or maybe that place is no longer a somewhere that interest them.

# Installation 

To use this app type json-server --watch db.json in the terminal and a live server that takes you to localhost:5500
